## Approah 1: 
Main.ipynb will preprocess the testing data and import the pre-trained model, directly generate the prediction without any model training

### How to run
1. Upload the test.csv inside the data folder 
2. Run the main.ipynb, which will load the pre-trained model Final_Model.joblib
3. submission.csv will be generate to be submit to Kaggle


## Approach 2: 
5001_model_training_Process.ipynb will rerun the whole training process, preprocess the testing data and generate the prediction based on the new trained model 
5001_model_training_Process.ipynb also include the data exploration and gridesearch process

### How to run
1. Upload the test.csv inside the data folder 
2. Run the 5001_model_training_Process.ipynb
3. submission.csv will be generate to be submit to Kaggle
